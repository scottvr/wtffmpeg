# name: null
# desc: a blank system prompt for exactly that purpose

# and also to demonstrate that lines starting with a # are ignnored
# so you can do "front matter" style tagging if you like (as above)

# if you have a filename and a filename.txt, the one with no extension 
# will take precedence, so "--profile filename" and "--profile filename.txt"
# but having both files with the same basename is probably a bad idea. Just sayin'
